# Userbase-React-Redux

This is a starter app for using the database - [Userbase](https://userbase.com) with a front end only application built with React and Redux.

This repository is a fork from my other repository [SAASiFy](https://github.com/saas-developer/saasify) which was created for the Udemy course [SaasiFy - Build a complete SAAS App this weekend](https://www.udemy.com/course/saasify-build-a-complete-saas-app-this-weekend/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Reinitialize the git by running `rm -rf .git` and `git init`.
3. Go to client directory and run `npm install`
